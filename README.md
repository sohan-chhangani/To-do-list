# To-do-list
In this project i have used Bootstrap which can be easily seen in the main html file, 
While i haven't used much of CSS mostly a few inline that too visible in html file.
In case of javascript i have created 3 actions create new task, delete task and show list.
All the mentioned action are aailable in script js file.
Open access to anyone simply download the zip file or the code file run and use it as per requirement.
